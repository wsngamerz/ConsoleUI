ConsoleUI

ConsoleUI is meant to be a small utility library written in C#
to quicky create a user interface for small projects

Components:
- [x] Menu
- [ ] Progress Bar
- [ ] File Selector

TODO:
- [ ] Components
- [ ] Create a Layout Class / System
      - Will likely be a simple grid System
      - rows, columns, rowspan, colspan should suffice
      - should implement component class so a SubGrid should just work
